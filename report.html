            <ol>

                    I chose to create a website for my sorority, Alpha Omega Epsilons(AOE), chapter here at JMU. I hope that it can continue to be improved and used for my chapter in the future. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I created all the pages on my website and did not get them from anywhere else. The images that I used were either taken by an active member of my sorority and I was given permission to use them or I downloaded from the official Alpha Omega Epsilon sorority site. As an active member I am allowed to use their images. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    My site has five pages. One of the files is named index.html and this is the home page of my website. I also have a file named active-members.html, current-exec.html, history.html, and values-facts.html. Each of these serves a specific purpose and is named for that purpose. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    At the top of each of my pages there is a consistent header that includes the AOE logo. There is also a navigation bar in this header.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is a navigation bar that is consistent among all the pages. It is part of the header. In it, there are links to each of the pages on the website that can be found either as the <q>Home</q> button or in a labeled dropdown menu. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    My site changed layouts depending on the screen size using media queries. One example is In current-exec.html and active-members.html where the images that had been a row turn into a column. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The header is consistent among all the pages, therefore there is a shared css file called style-sheet-project1.css. Each other page has its own style sheet (named appropriate) because their page contentâ€™s are different. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are images of the AOE logo, exec member, and active members. Each image is labeled with the alt attribute and describes the picture adequately. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every page has an AOE favicon that changes depending on what software you are accessing the website on. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    All of the images that I used are placed in an <q>images</q> folder. All of my css files that I used are in a folder labeled <q>css</q>. I did not use any javaScript but there is an empty folder names <q>js</q>
                </li>
                <li>
                    I did not use any libraries or frameworks such as Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I checked all my code with the Nu Validator and they all validate without warnings or errors. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    All of my pages are neatly aligned. On pages where there is mostly text it is aligned to the left. On pages where there are mostly images it is aligned in the center.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All of the pages of my website are spaced nicely and neatly. Text does not bleed against the edges of their boxes. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I used two different font types: sans-serif for most of the headings and serif for the paragraphs. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is a form at the bottom of the active-members.html page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is a link to the AOE instagram at the bottom of each page in the footer. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I made the names of all my id&#39;s and classes lower case and have <q>-</q> between words.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is an animation on the <q>active members</q> page. When a user hovers over the family photos, all the names of the family members will appear. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    My project1 repository is shared with hcientist on github. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The names of all my file files are lowercase and only have alphanumeric characters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Both https://project1.vivianstewart.me and http://project1.vivianstewart.me resolve to my project 1 site and the latter of the two links redirect to the former.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My site is served out over HTTPS on port 443. I used the recommended setup given in the instructions. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users who access my sire over HTTP on port 80 are redirected to port 443. I used the recommended setup given in the instructions.

                <li>
                    Since I started this project I have slowly been pushing changes to my repository.

                    There is a file called report.html that can be accessed through https://project1.vivianstewart/report.html that covers how I met the expectations.
