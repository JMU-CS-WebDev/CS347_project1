                        The colors of Alpha Omega Epsilon are royal blue, silver, and white.
                        Each of these colors are symbolic to the sorority and their meanings
                        are known only to the Sisters of Alpha Omega Epsilon.

                        The flowers of Alpha Omega Epsilon Sorority are the white carnation
                        for the candidates, the white rose for the actives, and the calla

                    <p>
                        A Mascot is any person, animal or thing thought to bring good luck by 
                        being present. Therefore, the Gamma Chapter proposed that a mascot be 
                        chosen to represent our sorority. After discussion it was decided that 
                        the dolphin be chosen as our mascot. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We feel that a dolphin would be an excellent representation 
                        of A&Omega;E for the following reasons: 
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Dolphins are considered to be one of the most 
                                intellectual mammals known to man, just as STEM 
                                fields are considered an extremely intellectual career.

                                Happy and sociable are two common descriptions of a 
                                dolphinâ€™s behavior. As the dolphins display these 
                                characteristics so do the sisters of A&Omega;E. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There are forty different species of dolphins, which 
                                coexist in friendship. Women of different backgrounds 
                                come together with A&Omega;E and work in friendship. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Dolphins are helpful with navigation and rescue efforts. 
                                The sisters of our sorority are helpful through community 
                                service and support systems for fellow female STEM students. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Female dolphins are livelier and more inquisitive than male dolphins. The sisters of A&Omega;E are known for their inquisitive minds. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Dolphins communicate through a distinctive pattern of clicks 
                                and whistling sounds of their echolocations. The Chapters of 
                                A&Omega;E communicate through an integrated network. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                For centuries, sailors have regarded the presence of dolphins 
                                near ships as a sign of a smooth voyage and good luck. 
                                A mascot is a symbol of good luck and we feel that the dolphin 
                                would be an ideal mascot for A&Omega;E.
